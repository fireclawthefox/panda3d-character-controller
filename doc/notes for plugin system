Fly mode:
    add request method so plugins won't overwrite requests of other plugins. Requesting plugins should tell the function if they want to set the fly mode active or inactive and a requester ID (probably the id of the plugin)



What is needed by plugins:

    setting position
    setting rotations
    setting animation states
    setting fly mode

    restrict movements
        x/y/z and headding (other rotations should never be changed)

    set player heading to face specific directions (e.g. Walls)

    add rays and other collision detection solids and react to them accordingly
    use existing collision geometry and react to collisions of those

    change the characters speed

    check direction of the player

    register new states
